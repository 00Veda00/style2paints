# Welcome to style2paints V4!

Style2paints V4 is the current best AI driven lineart colorization tool.

Different from presious end-to-end image-to-image translation methods, style2paints V4 is the **first** system to colorize a lineart **in real-life human workflow**, and the outputs are **layered**.

Inputs:

    ● Linearts
    ● (with or without) Human hints
    ● (with or without) Color style reference images

Outputs:

    ● Automatic color flattening without lines (solid/flat/inherent/固有色/底色 color layer)
    ● Automatic color flattening with black lines
    ● Automatic colorization without lines
    ● Automatic colorization with black lines
    ● Automatic colorization with colored lines
    ● Automatic rendering (separated layer)
    ● Automatic rendered colorization

Style2paints V4 gives you results of the current highest quality. You are able to get separated layers from our system. These layers can be directly used in your painting workflow. Different from all previous AI driven colorization tools, our results are not 'JPG/PNG' images, and in fact, our results are 'PSD' layers.

# Help human via obeying their standard workflow!

Most human artists are familiar with this workflow:

    sketching -> color filling/flattening -> gradients/details adding -> shading

And the corresponding layers are:

    lineart layers + flat color layers + gradient layers + shading layers
    
Our AI is also working in this way. Here is a fully automatic example:

*\*CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 (c) style2paints, 2018. It is OK for ACM/IEEE fair use (for comparison).*

Note that in this example, all step 123 are fully automatic without any human hint points or local manipulation. You can follow our [user instruction](https://style2paints.github.io/) to reproduce this result.
